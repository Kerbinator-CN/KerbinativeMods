# KerbinativeMods
For KSP.My First one!
Recently working on Three-body system with Kopernicus and Principia.
Base mods:
Kopernicus,Kopernicus expansion
Textures will be from Real Solar System,Outer planets mod & SLIPPIST-1
Principia patch will be modified from Real Solar System &TRAPPIST-1 patch
We will use a MATLAB planar TBP periodic solution and convert it into initial state manually
*Unfortunately the three objects may be the same size......*
We will try to prevent planets from escaping the TBP star system.
And that is for all,hope you enjoy within months......
------------------------------------------
*Because of some issues with my PC the version was 1.2.2 because Kopernicus won`t work on my PC on 1.3.1 & 1.6.1*
*Planet will fit RSS-RO standard may be uncomfortable for some players especially stock players*
STARTUP:
I will update planets&Suns data first.

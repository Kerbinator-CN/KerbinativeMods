# KerbinativeMods
For KSP.My First one!
Recently working on Three-body system with Kopernicus and Principia.
Base mods:
Kopernicus,Kopernicus expansion
Textures will be from Real Solar System,Outer planets mod & SLIPPIST-1
Principia patch will be modified from Real Solar System &TRAPPIST-1 patch
We will use a MATLAB planar TBP periodic solution and convert it into initial state manually
*Unfortunately the three objects may be the same size......*
We will try to prevent planets from escaping the TBP star system.
And that`s for all,hope you enjoy within months......
